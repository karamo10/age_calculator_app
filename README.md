T# Project Title

This project was created with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.

**Note**: Media queries are always a challenge for me, and I continue to work on improving my skills with them.

I also learned about the JavaScript Date object in this project, which helped me gain a better understanding of working with dates.
